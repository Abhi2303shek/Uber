# 🚖 Uber Ride Analytics | SQL Business Intelligence Case Study

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores ride-hailing operational data using **MySQL** to uncover the business story hidden beneath bookings, cancellations, revenue flows, and service performance.

Rather than running isolated queries, the focus was to understand:

> Where is the business truly making money?
> Where is it silently losing efficiency?
> And what patterns drive rider and driver behaviour?

# 🎯 The Story the Data Revealed

Behind thousands of bookings, a clear narrative emerged:

### 💰 Revenue Is Not Just About Volume

Peak hours were driving disproportionate revenue impact. Certain ride categories consistently delivered stronger revenue efficiency, while others contributed volume without proportional value.

The data highlighted how time, distance, and service type interact to shape profitability.

---

### 🚨 Cancellations Follow Predictable Patterns

Cancellations were not random.

Specific time windows and operational conditions showed a higher risk. Waiting time and trip length revealed behavioural signals influencing ride completion probability.

This exposed measurable friction points in the service experience.

---

### 👥 Customer Value Is Unevenly Distributed

A small segment of customers contributed a significantly larger share of revenue.

Understanding repeat behaviour and booking frequency provided insight into long-term value and retention dynamics.

---

### ⭐ Experience Impacts Operational Stability

Service ratings were not isolated feedback metrics — they were connected to ride conditions, waiting time, and trip characteristics.

This demonstrated how operational efficiency directly influences perceived service quality.

---

### ⏱ Efficiency Drives Business Health

Arrival times, acceptance times, and incomplete rides revealed subtle inefficiencies that compound over scale.

Optimising these operational levers could significantly reduce cancellations and improve revenue realisation.
